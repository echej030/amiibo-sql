# amiibo-sql

Like many of you these days I had nothing but free time so I decided to start learning sql, however, I still struggled because I personally am not the most focused unless I'm
using data I am actually interested. As such, I've compiled this directory of amiibo's to practice manipulating data with sql. I've intentionally left a typo with one 
characters 'star_sign' dataset which you can find by using the Distinct query or viewing a full list of the star_signs. Again, I wanted to do this and share it with others 
who want to learn something new, expecially since sql is used with so many services today.

To deploy an sql server on your localhost visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads and install the express edition and after download select 
"New SQL Server Stand-alone or add features to an existing installation".
